### How features are organized

Each folder inside `src/features/` represents one page group or feature. Inside a feature you can add these subfolders as needed:

```text
features/
└── your-feature/
    ├── components/   ← UI pieces specific to this feature
    ├── hooks/        ← React hooks used only here
    ├── types/        ← TypeScript interfaces and types
    ├── constants/    ← Static values, enums, config
    ├── services/     ← API calls or data-fetching logic
    └── utils/        ← Helper functions specific to this feature
```

Only create the subfolders you actually need. Don't create empty ones.

`features/shared/` is for anything genuinely used by two or more features (like `Emblem`).

Route files in `routes/` stay thin — they import from `features/` and compose the page.

### Key Pages

| URL                      | Description                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |

| `/tournaments`           | Tournament directory with game & status filters     |
| `/tournaments/:id`       | Tournament detail — overview, teams, bracket, rules |

| `/register`              | Create account with Discord → redirects to waitlist |
| `/waitlist`              | Pending verification — shown after registering      |

| `/teams`                 | My team overview — create or view current team      |
| `/teams/create`          | Create a new team                                   |
| `/teams/:id`             | Team detail — roster, invite members, tournament    |
| `/unauthorized`          | 403 access denied page                              |

## Notes for Contributors

- **Don't edit `routeTree.gen.ts`** — it's auto-generated by TanStack Router every time you save a route file. Any manual edits will be overwritten.
- To add a new page, create a `.tsx` file in `src/routes/`. The router picks it up on the next dev server restart.
- The `@/` import alias maps to `src/`. For example, `@/features/landing/components/Hero` → `src/features/landing/components/Hero.tsx`.
- When adding a new shadcn/ui component, run `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` — it drops into `src/components/ui/` automatically. Don't move it.
- The admin panel uses mock data from `src/lib/mock-data.ts`. No real backend or auth is connected yet.
- Authentication uses Discord OAuth2. The placeholder service is at `src/features/auth/services/discord.ts`. To wire it up: create a Discord app at https://discord.com/developers/applications, set `VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `VITE_DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI` in a `.env` file, then implement the `exchangeCodeForToken` and `getDiscordUser` functions in a server function.
- User roles are defined in `src/features/auth/types/index.ts`. New registrations get `not_verified` and land on `/waitlist`. An admin manually sets the role to `verified` to grant full access.
- The session store at `src/features/auth/store/session.ts` is a `sessionStorage` placeholder. Replace it with real session management (JWT cookie, server-side session, etc.) when the backend is ready.

## Current Status

The project is currently frontend-only and uses mock data for development.

### Completed

- ✅ Landing Page
- ✅ Login — Discord OAuth2 UI (placeholder, backend not wired)
- ✅ Registration — Discord OAuth2 UI → redirects to waitlist
- ✅ Waitlist page — shown to `not_verified` users after registering
- ✅ Tournament Directory — frontend with mock data
- ✅ Tournament Details Page — frontend with mock data (overview, teams, bracket, rules)
- ✅ Admin Dashboard UI — frontend with mock data
- ✅ Member Dashboard — `/dashboard` (verified session required)
- ✅ Member Profile Page — `/members/:slug` (public, session-aware)
- ✅ Teams — `/teams`, `/teams/create`, `/teams/:id` (create team, invite members, view roster)

### Next Up

1. Discord OAuth2 backend integration (callback route, token exchange, session)
2. Admin: user verification flow (change role `not_verified` → `verified`)
3. Tournament Registration Flow from team page
4. User Profile editing (social links, bio, riot account)
5. Notifications & Announcements

### Notes

- No backend has been implemented yet.
- No database is connected.
- Authentication is not functional yet. Registration simulates a session in `sessionStorage` and redirects to `/waitlist`.
- All users, teams, tournaments, and registrations currently use mock data.
